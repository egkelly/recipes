# Caramelized Apple Pie
## Ingredients: 
* **3 pounds** Pink Lady apples (6 to 7 medium) or other baking apples, such as honeycrisp or Granny Smith, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch wedges
* **3/4 cup (150 grams)** granulated sugar
* **3 TBSP** unsalted butter, cut into pieces
* **1/2 tsp** Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1/4 teaspoon Morton kosher salt
* **2 recipes** [Flaky Pie Crust](FlakyPieCrust.md) chilled
* **All-purpose flour**, for rolling dough
* **1 TBSP** cornstarch
* **1 TBSP** apple cider vinegar
* **1 large egg**, beaten
* **Demerara sugar**, for topping
* **Vanilla ice cream**, for serving

## Instructions:

1. Heat oven to 300 degrees. Place the apples in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish and set aside.
2. Fill a glass with water, place a pastry brush inside and set next to the stove. Combine the sugar and 1/4 cup/60 milliliters water in a small saucepan and stir gently with a heatproof spatula over medium-high heat just until it comes to a boil and the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Continue to cook without stirring, swirling the pan frequently and using the wet brush to brush down any undissolved sugar crystals on the sides of the pan, until the syrup starts to turn a faint golden color, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, swirling the pan, until it turns deep amber, about 1 minute longer. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately add the butter one piece at a time, stirring to incorporate it (be careful, it will sputter). Add the salt and stir vigorously until you have a smooth caramel.
3. Drizzle the hot caramel evenly over the apples and transfer the baking dish to the oven. Bake, gently tossing the apples once, until they have released their juices and the tip of a paring knife slides easily into the slices, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Turn the oven off.
4. When the baking dish is cool enough to handle, transfer it to the refrigerator and chill uncovered at least until the apple mixture is room temperature, 30 to 45 minutes, but preferably until cold, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. When the mixture is cool, stir together cornstarch and vinegar in a small bowl with a fork until cornstarch dissolves. Remove the pan from the refrigerator and scrape the mixture onto the apples and toss gently to combine.
5. Remove one portion of cold pie dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a minute or two to soften slightly. Unwrap the dough and place it on a lightly floured surface. Use a rolling pin to beat the dough evenly across the surface, applying enough force to leave an imprint but not enough to crack or splinter it. Continue to beat the dough, lifting it frequently and adding more flour if needed to prevent sticking, until it’s just under ½-inch thick. This makes the dough pliable and easier to roll out while cold. Dust underneath and on top of the dough with more flour, then roll it out, frequently lifting and rotating the dough to work it into a round, until it’s about ⅛-inch thick and 13 inches in diameter.
6. Transfer the dough round to a 9-inch pie plate, preferably glass, centering it and letting the dough slump down the sides into the bottom. Firmly press dough into the bottom and up the sides of the plate, ensuring contact everywhere and taking care not to stretch it. Scrape the apple mixture into the pie plate. Press gently on the apples to eliminate air gaps, then transfer the pie plate to the refrigerator.
7. Roll out the second portion of dough just as you did the first. Remove the pie plate from the refrigerator and brush the border of dough around the filling with the beaten egg. Place the second round of dough over the pie, letting it settle over the filling. Press firmly all the way around the rim of the pie plate with your fingertips to seal the two layers of dough together, then use a paring knife to trim away the excess dough from around the rim. Using the tines of a fork, press around the border of the pie again to crimp it, dipping the fork in flour if needed to prevent sticking. (Alternatively, finish the pie with a lattice top, cutting the dough into strips and weaving as desired.)
8. Brush the entire surface of the pie with the egg, then generously sprinkle the top with Demerara sugar. Freeze the assembled pie just until the dough is cold and firm, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 425 degrees.
9. Remove the pie from the freezer and use the paring knife to cut several slits in the lid to allow steam to escape during baking. (Skip this step if you wove a lattice top.) Place the pie on a foil-lined baking sheet and transfer to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to bake until the pastry is deep golden brown, another 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. Let cool completely before slicing and serving with vanilla ice cream.
