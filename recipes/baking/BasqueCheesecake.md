# Basque Cheesecake

Recipe adapted from NYT Cooking

## Ingredients

* Unsalted butter or nonstick spray, for greasing the pan
* **1 3/4 cups/350 grams** granulated sugar
* **2 1/4 pounds/36 ounces** cream cheese, at room temperature
* **1/4 teaspoon** kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
* **5 large** eggs
* **2 cups/480 milliliters** heavy cream
* **1/4 cup/30 grams** all-purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Place a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 10-inch springform pan and line with parchment paper, leaving 2 to 3 inches overhanging the top of the pan. (You can trace and cut a circle to fit the base and then cut a band of paper to fit neatly around the sides, but the more rustic and simple method is to press an entire sheet into the pan, pleating the paper where it begins to crease. If you use multiple sheets of parchment, grease in between the layers so that they stick and lay flat.)
2. In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the sugar and cream cheese until smooth. (This can be done by hand as well; beat with a wooden spoon for about 5 minutes.)
3. Add the salt and mix. Add the eggs one by one and beat until fully incorporated. Beat in the cream. Sift in the flour, then mix it in on low.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until browned and almost burnt on top, 50 to 60 minutes. The center will still be quite jiggly. Remove the cake from the oven and cool completely on a rack. It will have risen significantly, nearly past the top of the pan, but it will sink in the center as it cools.
5. Before serving, remove the rim of the springform and gently tug away the parchment paper. Serve at room temperature.
