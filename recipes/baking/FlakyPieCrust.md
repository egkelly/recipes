# Flaky Pie Crust
## Ingredients
* **1 1/2 cup (202 g)** all-purpose flour
* **1 TBSP** sugar
* **1 tsp** Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1/2 teaspoon Morton kosher salt
* **10 TBSP (141 g)** unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, chilled
* **1/2 cup (120 mL)** ice water
## Instructions
1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Add the butter cubes to the dry ingredients and toss, separating and coating them in the flour mixture. Use your fingertips to quickly break and smash the butter so the largest pieces are about the size of a chickpea. Make a well in the center of the bowl and add ⅓ cup/80 milliliters ice water, straining out any ice (discard remaining ice water). Stir well with a fork to distribute the water until you have a clumpy mixture with lots of dry spots, then tip the contents of the bowl out onto a clean work surface, scraping out the bowl.
2. Using a bench or bowl scraper, chop the mixture, breaking up the clumps and periodically tossing and pushing the mixture back into a pile. Continue chopping and tossing until the largest bits are about the size of a pea and no loose flour remains on the work surface.
3. Push the mixture into a pile and firmly pat the dough into a square, then use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough in both directions until it’s 1/2-inch thick. Pat the 4 sides with your hands or the scraper to square off and compact the dough, then, using the scraper or a knife, cut the dough into quarters. Using the scraper to help you, lift up the 4 pieces 1 at a time and stack on top of one another, tucking any loose bits between the layers. Use the scraper to lift the dough and dust underneath with more flour, then flatten it into a 3/4-inch-thick disk, dusting the top with flour if needed to prevent sticking.
4. Wrap the dough in plastic or reusable food wrap, then roll over the wrapped dough with the rolling pin to flatten and force it to fill out the plastic or food wrap (applying this pressure will help prevent cracking later). Transfer to the refrigerator and chill until cold and firm, at least 2 hours.
## Notes
* This recipe makes enough dough for 1 double-crust pie or 2 single-crust pies. If you’re making a single-crust pie, you can freeze the second portion of dough for up to 3 months. To use, transfer the dough to the refrigerator to thaw overnight, then proceed with the recipe as written.
* If you don’t have a bench or bowl scraper, you can use a chef’s knife to chop the dough. Just be careful not to cut yourself.
* If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use a wine bottle instead.
* If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a pastry blender or your fingertips to cut the butter into the flour mixture. Work quickly to keep the butter cold.
* If you don’t have a scale, you can use the spoon-and-sweep method to measure the flour. To do this, use a spoon to fluff up the flour in the bag. Use a spoon to scoop the flour into a measuring cup until it is heaped on top. Take a butterknife and level off the top. This should give you the most accurate measurement for flour.
* If you don’t have a scale, you can use the water displacement method to measure the water. Fill a liquid measuring cup with 1/2 cup of water. Add the butter to the water until the water reaches 3/4 cup. Remove the butter and use the water for the recipe.
