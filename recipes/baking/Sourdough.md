## Process
### Levain
* 30g ripe starter
* 30g whole wheat flour
* 30g bread flour
* 60g water

Mix and let sit overnight (start at ~10pm)

### Autolyse Dough
* 822g bread flour
* 65g whole wheat flour
* 650g water

The next morning, mix and let sit for 2 hours

### Final Mix
* 60-90g water
* 20g salt
* Levain
* Autolyse dough

Combine autolyse, levain, and salt. Stream in water until dough is appropriately wet. If the dough starts to get too soupy, stop adding water.

### Bulk Fermentation, Folding, and Overnight Proof
Every 15 minutes for the first hour, stretch and fold the dough. Then, fold every 30 minutes for the next 2 hours. Let the dough rest for the remaining time, about 4-8 hours depending on how warm the kitchen is. After bulk fermentation, cut dough into halves, shape, and place in a floured banneton. Let the dough proof overnight in the fridge.

### Baking
Preheat oven to 450F an hour before baking. Remove single banneton from the fridge and let rest on the counter while the oven preheats. Bake in dutch oven for 20 minutes with the lid on, then 30-40 minutes with the lid off. When the first loaf has gone into the oven, remove the second loaf from the fridge and let rest on the counter. Repeat baking process for the second loaf.
